		<h2> About Me </h2>
		<p class= "event">
			I was born in the Bronx, which explains my love of the arts as I grew up, I always listened to rap/hiphop, latin music, jazz, rock. Books, poetry, videogames were much of my childhood as well. This combination of art styles along with the growth of technology over the years have a love for both arts and science. Computer Science seemed like the perfect choice, especially since it would help me in game design.

			I graduated from Cardinal Spellman High School which is where I met two influential teachers. One was my English teacher, Mr. Drew, and the other my math teacher, Mrs. Mosquera. It was Mrs. Mosquera that first introduced me to computer science as a major which started me down the career choice. Mr. Drew was more of a teacher who influenced me on the choices I made to become a game developer. He talked about how he wanted to be a writer and started out in another field before changing to english. I was the same way, I first thought of majoring in psychology, before ultimately changing to computer science.

			I wasn't always sure about computer science however. I first went to NYIT (New York Institute of Technology), and it was not the best school. The teacher's barely tried to teach, and I felt like I had made a mistake. That changed when I came to Lehman. Many of the teacher's and staff felt like they cared, and wanted to teach you how to succeed in the field. I felt confident and started working on my own solo projects.

			I hope to make my own production company, but for now, I am planning to move to Los Angeles to continue my education in game development.
