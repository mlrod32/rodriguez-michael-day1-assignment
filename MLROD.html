					My name is Michael Luis Rodriguez and I am a Computer Science student at Lehman College going on my 4<sup>th</sup> year in college. Most of my passion lies in game development specifically as that is the field I wish to major in after Lehman in grad school.
				</p>
				<p>
					Games like <em> Silent Hill 2 </em> and <em> God of War </em> are a few of the games that have inspired me to be a game development. The reason behind game development as my major is because I've always enjoyed writting and programming, and since I've been playing games ever sicne I was a child, it made all the reason to make that my career of choice.
